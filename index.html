            <p><img class=pic src="assets/images/Pic2.jpg">Hey, my name is Michael Westley and I am excited to take this opportunity to introduce myself to you. I am a Florida native and spent almost my entire life in the Orlando area, I really believe it is because of this that I have become an enormous theme park geek!
                Theme parks have been a huge part of my life, in fact for 13 years of it, I dedicated myself to them as an employee of two of them boucing around through various positions and departments learning and growing along the way. I have a number of interests including,
                food, spending time outdoors, technology and travel. I have been married to my best friend, Brent for just about a year and together we have two cats, a dog and a guinea pig, so I guess you could say we also have a love for animals.
            </p>

            <p class=p2>I am incredibly excited about the next chapter of my life. Dropping everything I knew and taking this leap has been scary, but through a lot of dedication, lots of hard work and a ton of support I know that I have made the right choice to further myself. Taking 
                this leap was not only important for my own personal success, it was a way for me to change how I support my family and give us an opportunity to grow that family the way we really want.
